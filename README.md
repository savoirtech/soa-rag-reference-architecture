# High Level

One key to efficient Retrieval Augmented Generation is to pre-process
segment data and query embeddings before a user required to use them.

To achieve this an architect may design a data pipeline that contains
several stages.

## Data Source

## Data Landing Zone

## ETL

## Vector Database

## Agent System

# The Result

Once this pipeline is created, an agent may use the pre-populated
embedded store for the LLM.
